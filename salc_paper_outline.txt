"Was the 18th century a period of decline in India? Did the "fall" of the mughal empire hurl India into a period of political, economic, or cultural chaos? Or, are there alternative ways of regarding Indian conditions during this period?

The answer to this question (as to whether India was in a period of decline) is a heavily qualified "No." due to the fact that there were many geographic areas in play during the century. Let's list a few primary ones:

Bengal (Britain/EIC)
Delhi
Maratha-held territories
Surat, and that fun stuff
Awadh
Sikh Territories
The South

We should begin by addressing the transition from Mughal power. The fracturing of power in the overextended empire led to the rise of several local authorities gaining prominence. (See: Awadh) Pressure from the Marathas and British helped to concentrate military power.
